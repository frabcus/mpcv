        <h2>Why should candidates share their CV?</h2>

        <p>Sending a CV is usually the very first step of a job application.
        </p>

        <p>We believe it should also be the first step when people apply to become an MP.</p>

        <p>Voters can then look at the CVs, and assess skills and
        abilities before choosing who is best.
        </p>

        <h2>What can I do here?</h2>

        <p>You can browse the CVs we've already got, and
        ask your candidates to upload missing ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Why should candidates do this?</h2>

        <p>To be helpful to voters, so they can choose the best candidate.
        </p>

        <p>Or have a look at newspaper articles on the topic:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/28/ethics-chief-tell-voters-about-your-second-jobs-general-election-lord-bew-malcolm-rifkind-jack-straw">MP ethics chief: tell voters about your second jobs</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8583859.stm">MP hopefuls urged to declare interests</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's the long term aim?</h2>

        <p>Ultimately, we'd like the public to be more involved in the
        recruitment of MPs in lots of ways. Perhaps we can increase the
        quality, giving Prime Ministers more choice of high calibre people for
        senior roles.
